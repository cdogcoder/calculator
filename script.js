// Understand the problem:
// The task is to create a functioning calculator.
// The final product should have a usable user interface
// and should be able to perform the following functions:
// Do basic calculations between two operands (display the
// current number clicked, the operator with a different 
// background color upon button click, display the next
// number clicked, and display the result of the calculation
// in the output box upon 'equals' button click), perform 
// calculations across results (ex. if the 'equals' button
// is not pressed after one number, an operator, and then
// another number is clicked and another operator is clicked
// after, the result of the two operands and operator that was
// clicked before should appear in the output box as the current 
// number), clear the output box upon 'clear' button click, and
// delete numbers off the output box upon 'delete' button click.
// All of the number calculations should be done without the 
// assistance of functions like eval() and all element changes
// that occur on screen should be the product of event listeners
// and DOM manipulation.
